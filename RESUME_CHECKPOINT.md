CLOSE THE SETTLE HEAL ORPHAN WINDOW. Two gates, both still open. Fix before the
Noche UFC card (2026-09-12) settles, or it lands in the same trap Paris did.

  1. `last_completed_ufc_card` NEVER ADVANCES.
     `StorageService.setLastCompletedCard` exists (src/services/StorageService.ts
     ~172) but is not called when the event flips. After Paris it still read
     "UFC Fight Night: Hernandez vs. Rodrigues" (Aug 22) while upcoming_ufc_card
     had already moved to "Noche UFC: Silva vs. Delgado" (Sep 12) — so the card
     that just finished was in NEITHER record. Find the flip site (where
     upcoming_ufc_card is replaced) and set the outgoing card as completed there.
     *** This also neuters the cache-staleness fix shipped 2026-09-04 ***, which
     keys off those two records to decide a cached fighter has fought since the
     fetch. That fix is correct and currently inert.

  2. THE HEAL PATH IS GATED ON THE CURRENT BOARD.
     analyzer.ts ~27025 `if (!roster.has(fighterNorm.toLowerCase())) return;`
     with `rosterNameSet()` reading `allFighters`. Once the board shows the next
     card, the previous card's fighters can NEVER heal. Widen it to also admit
     fighters on last_completed_ufc_card (which item 1 makes reliable), or scope
     the heal by event rather than by roster.

  WHY IT MATTERS: results computed provisionally during/just after an event
  freeze permanently. On Paris that preserved a Fantasy value that graded a MISS
  as a HIT. Neither the Settle nor Force Backfill button rescues it —
  backfillUnresolvedFromKnownOutcomes only fills rows whose `result` is MISSING,
  so a present-but-WRONG row is invisible to it.
  Full write-up: [[project_settle_heal_orphan_window]].

##  2026-09-05 POST-CARD — THE METHOD PARSE BUG (FOUND, FIXED, DATA CORRECTED) ##
################################################################################
User spotted ONE wrong grade (Donchenko 96.8, real 81.83). Root cause was a
single regex, and my first theory (control time, from a 14.97 = 499s x 0.03
coincidence) was WRONG — it only fell when the real per-fight stats were put
beside the stored ones.

UFCStats wraps the Method VALUE in its own tag; Round and Time are bare text:
    <i class="b-fight-details__label">  Method:  </i>
    <i style="font-style: normal"> KO/TKO </i>
The parser demanded [A-Za-z] right after the label's </i>, hit that '<', and
returned null — so `method` was '' on EVERY fight it ever read. Empty method
falls through to the ROUND table: right by luck for a KO/SUB, and a round-3
FINISH bonus for a fight that went to the cards.
    FANTASY_SCORING  round3 45 vs decision 30 -> +15
    PRIZEPICKS       round3 30 vs decision 10 -> +20
Blast radius therefore = decision WINNERS ONLY. Predicted, then matched exactly.

SHIPPED: tolerant `(?:<[^>]*>\s*)*` on Method/Round/Time in src/background.ts.
CORRECTED: 26 Paris rows across BOTH shadow event spellings, 0 remaining, row
count unchanged. 7 graded picks moved HIT -> MISS (3 of Donchenko's 4 FP legs,
both of Michael Page's).
AUDITED CLEAN: 328 non-FP rows (SS/TD/KD/ctrl) verified against UFCStats — the
defect could never touch them, since none feed winBonus.

HISTORY SWEEP: 4890 rows matched against truth recomputed from the local
ufcstats_v51 cache (362 fighters / 2575 fights / 0 missing method). 4826 correct
(98.7%), 64 wrong, 4 grade flips. The wrong ones are the OPPOSITE, older defect —
the era when an unreadable method MINTED a decision and underpaid finishes by 60
(Fantasy) / 40 (PP). 3 corrected, all MISS -> HIT in the user's favour.
History is mostly clean because the analyzer BACKFILL re-derives from
fightHistory, whose method the analyzer's own fetcher parses fine ("U-DEC"). A
card only keeps the defect when the heal never reaches it — i.e. the orphan
window above.

*** LEFT ALONE ON PURPOSE, do not "fix" without evidence: ***
  · 24 rows at -5 and 6 at -10, INCLUDING LOSSES (win bonus is 0 either way, so
    it must be a stat term: 5 = a takedown or reversal, 10 = a knockdown).
    Cause unverified, ZERO grade flips. Correcting on the theory alone would
    repeat this week's three false positives.
  · 7572 rows unmatched (no cached fighter record) — UNAUDITED, not clean.
    Sweep coverage was 39%.

*** A NEGATIVE RESULT WORTH KEEPING: arithmetic ALONE cannot tell a decision
from a round-3 finish. *** The bonus gap is 20, which is divisible by 4, so the
PrizePicks residue test (Fantasy_PP - (0.5*SS + 10*KD + 5*TD) = 4*sub + WB) is
degenerate — both hypotheses always fit. The Fantasy side is underdetermined too
(nonSig, rev unknown). You need the real `method`. Do not try to infer it.

OTHER RESULT: Oumar Sy landed 3 takedowns; the TD UNDER 2.5 LOST. The pre-card
read (0/5 him, 0/13 conceded by Bukauskas, 18 fights without it ever happening)
was sound and it happened on the 19th. Variance, not a bad read.

*** THE ONE THAT MATTERED: NOTHING WAS DELETED, AND NOTHING SHOULD BE. ***
  A pre-card audit measured SS coverage of 31/28 on a 28-fighter card and I read
  it as cross-promotion ghost contamination. The user said "clear the ghost
  lines". READ-ONLY DIAGNOSIS FIRST (the standing rule) found ZERO ghosts — all
  four "extra" names are fighters on this card, and for three of them the VARIANT
  spelling holds the ONLY copy that book has:
      Dan Hooker       UD + PP have NO canonical record | variant: r1 14.5, ss 30.5
      Muhammad Naimov  UD + PP have NO canonical record | variant: ss 24.5/28.5, r1 11.5
      Matthieu Duclos  UD + PP have NO canonical record | variant: ss, ft, kd 0.5
      Klaudia Sygula   BT  has NO canonical record      | variant: ss 45.5
  A delete would have destroyed live lines the night before the card. The rule
  paid for itself. Do not shortcut it next time either.

SHIPPED: 3 NAME_ALIASES entries (src/config/index.ts), verified in the BUILT output:
      "Daniel Hooker" -> Dan Hooker | "Muhammadjon Naimov" -> Muhammad Naimov
      "Klaudia Sygu(U+0142)a" -> Klaudia Sygula      (total aliases now 52)
  The live board was never broken — namesMatch is surname-token based, which is
  why Hooker shows a PP SS 30.5 chip that exists only under "Daniel Hooker". The
  exposure is resolveVsArchive: it uses an EXACT event|normalizedName|propType
  key, so these legs would NOT have graded after settle. Same shape as the 8
  Orolbai/Sumudaerji legs from the 2026-08-30 audit.

*** OPEN, HIGH VALUE, DO AFTER THE CARD: THE NON-COMBINING DIACRITIC GAP. ***
  The 2026-09-03 fix — which I described as "completing the set" — closed only
  HALF the problem. All three normalizers strip combining marks ONLY
  (normalize NFD, then drop U+0300-U+036F). NFD does not decompose standalone
  letters, so these survive everywhere:
      L-stroke U+0142   o-slash   d-stroke   ae-ligature   sharp-s
  Worse: a normalizer that also filters [^a-z ] turns L-stroke into a SPACE, so
  "Sygula-with-L-stroke" becomes key "klaudia sygu a" and THE SURNAME TOKEN
  BECOMES "a" — which is how my probe filed a real fighter on this card as a
  GHOST, the one bucket whose recommended action is deletion.
  FIX DESIGNED BUT DELIBERATELY NOT SHIPPED: widening the strip re-keys recordKey
  across ~41k archive rows and must be collision-measured first, exactly as the
  combining-mark change was (0 collisions, 0 lossy). Not the night before a card.
  See [[project_diacritic_name_split]].

################################################################################
##  PRE-CARD AUDIT 2026-09-04 — WHAT SURVIVED VERIFICATION                     ##
################################################################################
Board: 16 picks (8 overs / 8 unders). Slate 96%, all five books fresh.
Probe: snippets/2026-09-04_best_picks_audit_readonly.js (read-only, validated).

CLEAN — do not re-investigate:
  · LINE-SIDE SELECTION: all 16 picks sit on the best PLACEABLE line. I first
    reported 2.0 and 1.0 point "giveaways" on Felipe Lima and Morgan Charriere.
    BOTH FALSE. bestSideLineForPick filters unplaceable books BEFORE sorting, and
    the SS-under gate is role-dependent: Pick6 = FAVOURITES only, Underdog =
    UNDERDOGS only. Lima is -205 (FAV) so UD 39.5 is unplaceable for him;
    Charriere is +170 (DOG) so P6 39.5 is unplaceable for HIM.
    *** THE MIRROR IMAGE IS THE DIAGNOSTIC *** — when both fighters in one fight
    show a "better" line on the OTHER's book, that is the role gate, not a
    sorting bug. Acting on it would have surfaced two unplaceable picks.
  · PLACEABILITY: Duclos (-118) and Keita (-395) are both FAVOURITES, so their
    Pick6 / Betr FP UNDERs are placeable. Flag raised, resolved clean.

RESOLVED 2026-09-04 21:30 — U1 OUMAR SY TD UNDER 2.5 IS NOT A JUNK LINE.
  I had flagged it as "highest-EV pick, zero cross-check, guard off": UD posted
  only 2 TD lines on the whole card, this is one, no book corroborates it, and
  the cross-book outlier guard was REMOVED FOR TD in MODEL v19. Checked the
  history instead of the books (ufcstats_v51_* cache, read-only):
      Oumar Sy  landed 3+ TD in  0/5  UFC fights   (0,2,1,2,2)  avg 1.40
      Bukauskas conceded 3+ in   0/13 UFC fights   avg 0.38
  EIGHTEEN fights, the OVER condition has never occurred. And conditioning on a
  LONG fight — the scenario that maximises takedowns — Sy's two full 15m fights
  produced 1 and 2; Bukauskas has gone 15m six times conceding 0,1,0,1,2,0. Both
  ceilings are exactly 2, so the OVER needs a career first from one of them.
  The line is high because of what Sy LOOKS like (grappler, sub finishes) rather
  than what he does: he subbed Tokkos with 2 TDs and was himself subbed by
  Cutelaba with 0. Guard being off is still true; the risk it guards against is
  not present here.
  CAVEATS KEPT: Sy's sample is 5 fights, and what the history confirms is the
  DIRECTION, not the model's specific 81%/+62% (which still comes from the
  unguarded TD path).

STILL OPEN — user's judgement, not defects:
  · U6 Duclos (n=1, avg 13.3 vs 67.5) and U8 Keita (n=1, avg 20.8 vs 93.5) are
    n=1 artifacts — exactly the regime MEASURED as worse than the league mean
    (t=-2.46). Keita is also a -395 FAVOURITE taking an FP UNDER, and FP is
    finish-weighted: an R1 finish is ~100 FP on bonuses alone, so the likeliest
    path for a heavy favourite blows through 93.5. All three books price him
    87-93.5; the model says 20.8 because it has seen him once.
  · 3 negative-EV overs (O6 -5%, O7 -4%, O8 -7%). O8 also carries
    "PROJ SAYS UNDER 3.7" — its own projection opposes the pick.
  · 4 of the 8 overs are FT OVER 14.99, ALL Underdog, ALL "UD ONLY" — half the
    column is one distance thesis on one book.
  · Felipe Lima is picked on BOTH sides with opposing fight-length needs:
    O7 FT OVER (needs distance) against U7 SS UNDER + U3 Charriere SS UNDER
    (need low volume). FT is SHARED — one fight, one duration.

COVERAGE, measured from the raw stores rather than the chips:
      fp 28/28 (P6:28 UD:9 PP:4 BT:6 — P6 monopoly, no FP shopping on this card)
      ss 31/28 -> duplicate spellings, explained above, NOT contamination
      ss_r1 14/28 (UD:12 DK:12)   td 13/28   ft 20/28   ctrl 10/28   kd 12/28
  *** UNDERDOG DID NOT POST THE FULL CARD ON R1 SS *** — 12 of 28, contrary to
  its usual behaviour. Treat R1 SS as informational here. Recorded in
  [[project_r1_ss_underdog_and_lean]].

################################################################################
##  UI — GLOW-UP 309m/n/o: THE STICKY STACK IS MEASURED NOW, NOT ASSUMED       ##
################################################################################
Root cause of a whole family of bugs: the rule
`.header, .filter-bar { position: relative }` (analyzer.html ~33206) has the SAME
specificity (0,1,0) as the `sticky` rules for BOTH .header and
.filter-bar-bottom, and wins on source order ~27,000 lines later. So NEITHER ever
stuck. On a relative element `top: 54px` is not a pin offset — it is a VISUAL
SHIFT that leaves the layout box behind, which is why the control bar painted
26px over the Slate Check banner while every geometry reading came back correct.
elementFromPoint found it in one line; reading geometry never could. FIVE
diagnoses failed first.

309o then removed the generator: every follower HARDCODED the bar's height, and
that height is CONTENT-DEPENDENT — measured 40px on the extension board and 47px
in the dev harness AT THE SAME 1280px WIDTH. Four shipped bugs came from that one
assumption (26px rail overlap, 309h's 6px, 309n's 54px strip, 309o's ~51px Parlay
Lab strip), each previously "fixed" by choosing a better constant.
NOW: publishChromeHeight() writes the real height to --chrome-h via a
ResizeObserver (plus a window resize listener, because the 1100px breakpoint
flips the bar sticky<->static and that does not fire a ResizeObserver).
.fighter-header-row / .data-subnav / .parlay-pool-head-sticky all use
`top: var(--chrome-h, 40px)`; the publisher writes 0 when the bar is static.
Layout chosen by the user (option B of three): bar pins at 0, site header keeps
scrolling away — 66px of pinned chrome instead of 120px.
TO RESTORE THE HEADER LATER: drop `.header` from the 33206 selector. `sticky` is
itself a positioned value, so the ::before scanline that rule exists to anchor
keeps working.

################################################################################
##  MY OWN ERROR RATE — READ BEFORE TRUSTING A PROBE                           ##
################################################################################
THREE probes this session re-implemented production matching WITHOUT production's
filters and reported phantom defects with full confidence:
  1. the line-shop check ignored the placeability gate -> two false "giveaways",
     and acting on it would have surfaced unplaceable picks;
  2. the ghost check ignored NAME_ALIASES -> re-reported Duclos, aliased 08-31;
  3. the ghost check's own normalizer mangled U+0142 -> filed a REAL FIGHTER as a
     ghost, the one bucket whose recommended action is DELETION.
[[feedback_test_inherited_premises]] already carried this rule from last session.
A probe must apply NAME_ALIASES and the placeability gates, or it is not
measuring what production does.

ALSO: the Best Picks DOM has five parsing traps, every one found by running
against the real markup and none visible in the code (full detail in the
snippet's header comment): data-fight is NULL; the BOOK PRECEDES THE LINE; FP
picks print NO stat label; a "PLACED UNDER FT" badge names a DIFFERENT stat and
hijacks side/stat parsing, so side and tier must come from the ROW CLASS; and
books render as full name OR abbreviation, so full-name-only matching returns
null for every DK pick.

STATE: everything below is SHIPPED, PUSHED and VERIFIED on BOTH branches
(feature/sleek-theme-v1 + master, parity checked each time). Nothing half-done.
UFC Paris (Hooker vs. Parnasse) fights SATURDAY 2026-09-05.

*** FIRST MOVE NEXT SESSION: IS THE SLATE COMPLETE YET? ***
  As of 13:30 on 09-03 Slate Check still showed 5 warnings and real gaps:
      P6 14 of 28 fighters without lines · PP 9 · UD 7 · BT 7 · DK none posted
  Betr FANTASY props dropped mid-afternoon and took the board 8 -> 11 picks, so
  props ARE flowing. Per [[feedback_audit_timing_full_props_friday]] do NOT audit
  until TD + R1 SS + CTRL + FP are actually on the board. Check the gaps first;
  if they have closed:
      1. AUTO-FETCH LINES
      2. GENERATE PREDICTIONS (MODEL v44 — the panel chip must say v44; the
         stored board is old and lines have moved all week)
      3. THEN invoke the ufc-lean-audit skill. That is what it is for.

*** AFTER THE CARD, NOT BEFORE: FP THIN-HISTORY SHRINKAGE. ***
  The delegated "should FP emit at n=1" question is ANSWERED BY MEASUREMENT, not
  opinion — see [[project_fp_thin_history_shrinkage]] for the full table and the
  ready-to-execute design. Headline: below 3 fights a fighter's own FP average is
  WORSE than assuming they are league-average (n=1-2, 485 fights, t=-2.46 on a
  test named in advance). n=1 alone is NOT individually significant (t=-1.50);
  the crossover is n~6, not 3. Probe:
  snippets/2026-09-03_fp_sample_size_readonly.js
  DEFERRED DELIBERATELY: modest effect, and it is a model change to the engine
  producing picks being bet on 09-05, with a subtle failure mode. GLOW-UP 306B/C
  already LABEL the affected rows in the meantime.
  KEY DESIGN CONSTRAINT so it is not got wrong later: do NOT shrink `avgFP` in
  place. It is built once in buildFighterDB (~analyzer.ts:1275) and feeds BOTH
  the model and the displayed "avg 28.8" text — shrinking in place would make the
  UI misreport a fact about the fighter. Add a separate shrunk field.

*** SECOND: THE v39 CHECK, WAITING SINCE 08-29. ***
  calcSSLean's duration-normalised hit rate needs DK ROUND MARKETS and DK has
  posted NOTHING all week ("DK none posted" as of 09-03). Once DK is in, read
  Hooker's SS lean reason for "(N/24 scaled to ~Xm)". Present = the term fired.
  HOOKER ONLY — Parnasse is a debut and calcSSLean bails at history.length < 3.

*** THIRD, ONLY AFTER THE CARD SETTLES: RUN 19. *** First learning cycle that is
  both line-trained (v40) and post-v41/v44. Re-run both loop probes:
      snippets/2026-09-01_learning_log_readonly.js   (SS)
      snippets/2026-09-01_fp_loop_readonly.js        (FP)

################################################################################

1. CHARRIERE HEAL QUESTION — CLOSED, NO BUG. He was never stale. All three of
   his rev=1 fights already include the reversal; the join is exact (evLoose
   identical, normalizeEvent true, date delta 0) so the detector evaluated his
   row on every run and flagged nothing. archivePerformanceForRosterFighter
   works. The checkpoint's premise had been carried as fact for two sessions
   without anyone dumping the row — see [[feedback_test_inherited_premises]].
   The 28 other stale-by-5xrev rows belong to fighters NOT on the current
   roster; the heal only touches the current card, so they cannot heal and will
   correct at each fighter's next appearance. EXPECTED BACKGROUND, not a bug.

   FIVE hypotheses died, all to data: the diacritic normalizer split as the
   CAUSE, storage-over-quota, an event-join mismatch, and (09-02) the four parse
   hypotheses. DO NOT RE-OPEN ANY OF THEM.

   *** THE QUOTA SCARE WAS MINE AND IT WAS WRONG. *** unlimitedStorage is
   already in the manifest; the 10485760 ceiling came from a constant I
   hardcoded into my own probe. A 7MB round-trip write landed clean
   (10.96MB -> 18.3MB, read back intact, no lastError). Storage sitting above
   10MB is FINE. DO NOT "reclaim space". A full backup was taken before any of
   it and NOTHING was deleted.

2. DIACRITIC FIXES (714c9f1 settle, 141e308 merge, e75c947 retraction).
   Books disagree on accents for ONE fighter: Betr posted "Morgan Charriere"
   ACCENTED on this card while pick6/underdog/prizepicks posted it plain, and
   the line archiver stores f.name RAW. _baseNorm (every settle-path name
   comparison) did not strip diacritics, so applyResult could never match the
   accented row: result-less forever, any leg on it ungradeable. Fixed.
   normalizeFighterName also now strips — but READ e75c947: I justified that one
   as fixing a LIVE board ghost and that claim is RETRACTED. The analyzer builds
   its own merge map on its own accent-stripping normalizeName
   (analyzer.ts:25004), so the board was never ghosting. The change is
   consistency hardening, not a demonstrated defect. See
   [[project_diacritic_name_split]] — PropArchiveService.normalizeName still
   does NOT strip and is deliberately left alone: it feeds recordKey, so
   stripping there changes row IDENTITY. Migration with a backup, not a
   one-liner.

3. GLOW-UP 305 — BEST PICKS TEN-LEVEL PASS (8143f6d L1-L5, 4ba6e9f L6-L10,
   plus a dedupe fix). Every level surfaced a value the code already computed
   and discarded. Full detail in [[project_ui_evolution_roadmap]].
   L1 line vintage (Best Picks referenced movement ZERO times while
   _openingLines powers all of Line Movers) · L2 real posted price + vig ·
   L3 recalibration mark · L4 bpViewMetric kept ONE of computeDetailedEV's six
   fields · L5 per-pick line age · L6 placed-leg line vintage, which CLOSES the
   item [[project_placed_leg_vs_board_line_vintage]] carried as open ·
   L7 per-column movement split · L8 MOVE sort · L9 REAL ODDS filter ·
   L10 exposure-strip price provenance.

   VERIFIED ON THE LIVE BOARD, both branches of the sign convention:
     Benouaich over ↑12.5→14.99 neg · Donchenko over ↑87.5→89.5 neg
     Keita under ↑92.5→93.5 pos · Charriere under ↑33.5→39.5 pos
   All four moved UP and the colour split purely on LEAN — which rules out the
   failure mode a mixed sample could not have (colour following the delta sign
   rather than favourability). The sign convention needs no further caveating.

   STILL UNEXERCISED: the ⏱ age chip. Correctly so — the stores were 49 MINUTES
   old, against a 12h floor. It will fire the first time a board goes stale
   overnight. Everything else has now run on real data, including L2's ≈ -110
   (the four Betr FP rows carry no posted side odds) and L10's "4/11 assumed
   price".

################################################################################
##  ALSO SHIPPED 2026-09-03 — GLOW-UP 306 A/B/C                               ##
################################################################################
All three verified on the LIVE board, not just the harness.

306A QUALIFIED TOP PICK. The badge marks rank #1 under the CURRENT sort, and
   MODEL sort is score + demotions — not edge, price quality or caveat count. So
   the row acted on first can be the worst in its column wearing an unqualified
   endorsement. Live: Mario Pinto renders "TOP PICK ⚠3" (projection conflict +
   negative edge + assumed price). `caveats` was deliberately NOT widened —
   CLEAN / FLAGGED / 2+ CAVEATS all read that number and changing it would
   silently rewrite a board read every card.
   Signalled by GLYPH + BORDER STYLE, never colour: --gold and --amber are the
   SAME hex #f8c64a. Verified in the stylesheet, not assumed.

306B EXTREME-EDGE GUARD (⚠ CHECK LINE). The column header has flagged a
   stretched average delta since GLOW-UP 199 L5; the ROW never got the check.
   Threshold |edge|/line >= 0.35, measured against the LINE because FP lines run
   ~90 and SS ~35. Live verification: 11/11 rows agree, exactly one flagged
   (Keita 0.67); Pinto at 0.23 correctly does not. WARNS, never suppresses.

306C THIN-SAMPLE MARK (⌀ n=N). Following 306B to its cause rather than stopping
   at the flag: Keita's entire UFCStats record is ONE fight — a split-decision
   loss, 900s, 52 sig strikes. The LINE was never the outlier (Betr FP lines
   cluster 89-95 card-wide, so combo-prop and stat-scale are both ruled out);
   his AVERAGE is. And FP being finish-and-win weighted, 28.8 is depressed by
   the missing win bonus — the number describes the RESULT, not the fighter.
   VERIFIED ASYMMETRY, read from source: calcSSLean / calcSSR1Lean / calcTDLean
   / calcCTRLLean all `return null` below 3 fights; calcFTLean falls back to an
   explicitly-labelled MARKET-ONLY lean; FP alone emits an ordinary, unlabelled
   pick. FP confidence IS damped (sampleSizeFactor (n-3)/10, x0.64 at n=1) but
   never refused and never marked.
   NOT suppressed, deliberately — dropping FP picks could remove real edges, and
   calcFTLean sets the repo's precedent: emit it, but say so. Live: Keita ⌀ n=1,
   and Benouaich picks it up on FT's market-only path, which is exactly the two
   cases predicted and no others.

*** OPEN, AND IT IS THE USER'S CALL, NOT MINE: should the FP engine emit a lean
    at all at n=1, or fall back to a market-only form the way calcFTLean does?
    That is a MODEL change with real downside either way and should be measured
    against the archive before anyone argues it. ***

NOT DONE, deliberately, so it is not re-proposed: row-height normalisation.
Measured 93-116px, a 23px spread that is entirely content-driven (two-line
reasons + factor rails). GLOW-UP 198 L5 already settled this trade-off for this
repo — "visibility beats layout tidiness". Book-disagreement spread was also NOT
rebuilt: the 🏪 badge already reads "best of 4 · 1.0".

STILL UNEXERCISED ON LIVE DATA: the ⏱ age chip only. Correctly so — the stores
were 49 MINUTES old against a 12h floor. It fires the first time a board goes
stale overnight.

VERIFIED ON THE LIVE BOARD.

THE GAP: analyzeSlipLegs computed `byHits` (probability of EXACTLY k legs
hitting), priced every EV number from it, then did not return it. So the UI could
only ever describe the ALL-HIT case. Fine for UD and PP Power, which are
single-tier. Badly wrong for PP Flex, where a 5-leg pays 10x / 2x / 0.4x at
5 / 4 / 3 hits: most of the EV lives in tiers the deck never mentioned, and the
0.4x tier PAYS while losing 60% of stake.

  L3 plumbing FIRST — byHits, ladder, P(profit), break-even and a paying-tier
     count returned, so ladder / tiles / EV all read ONE distribution.
  L1 payout ladder: hits, multiplier, probability, green if it beats the stake,
     RED if it pays and still loses.
  L2 break-even marker + explicit "need N/M to profit".
  L5 P(profit) — every tier above 1.0x summed. NOT the all-hit number.
  L4 EV DRAG chip.

*** L4 IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM WEAKEST — keep them straight. *** WEAKEST
names the lowest-CONFIDENCE leg. DRAG re-prices the slip WITHOUT each leg and
names whichever removal RAISES EV most. A confident leg correlated with one
already on the slip can cost more than a weak independent one, because
correlation is priced into the joint distribution and never shows in a leg's own
confidence number. Silent when it would only repeat WEAKEST.

*** THE DESIGN BUG THIS ALMOST SHIPPED WITH, and how it was caught. ***
L1 first tied the ladder to evRows[0]. On a real 3-leg slip UD 6x (single tier)
and PP Flex BOTH priced -20%, UD sorted first, and NOTHING rendered — the one
book with partial tiers was suppressed exactly where it mattered. The math was
correct and a unit test would have passed; the feature was simply UNREACHABLE.
Only looking at a real slip found it, and the harness could not have (its Best
Picks renders empty on the current backup).
Now: highest-EV book that ACTUALLY has >1 paying tier, labelled with that book's
name AND its own EV when it is not the starred row. P(profit) moved out of the
deck into the ladder for the same reason — it is per-book, and the deck's BEST
BOOK tile can now name a different book.
GENERALISE: unit tests settle "is this number right"; only a real screenshot
settles "can anyone actually see it".

LIVE NUMBERS, 3 legs (Peek SS + Keita FP + Donchenko FP):
  UD 6x       +118% EV, all-or-nothing, COMBINED ~36%
  PP Flex     +38%  EV, P(profit) ~82%  (3/3 2.25x 36% | 2/3 1.25x 45%)
Same three legs, completely different bets. Only the first was visible before.

##  PRE-CARD DATA HYGIENE 2026-09-03 — ALL CLEAN, NOTHING OUTSTANDING          ##
################################################################################

*** THE ONE THAT MATTERED: SATURDAY'S LEGS ALL GRADE. ***
  All 21 placed legs on the Hooker/Parnasse card resolve to archive rows they can
  settle against. That was the question worth asking before the card and it is
  answered. No action needed.

SHIPPED: PropArchiveService.normalizeName now STRIPS DIACRITICS, completing the
  set (analyzer normalizeName and background _baseNorm already did). This was the
  one that mattered most because it feeds recordKey — row IDENTITY — so until now
  'Fares Ziam' / 'Morgan Charriere' were SEPARATE identities from their plain
  twins and updateResult could not reach them.
  *** I had called this "a migration with a backup, not a one-liner". That was
  OVER-CAUTIOUS and the measurement says so — retracted. *** recordKey was
  recomputed under both normalizers across all 40,867 rows:
      NEW collisions caused by stripping: 0  |  of those LOSSY: 0
  Eleven of the twelve call sites are LOOKUPS, where finding more IS the fix;
  only recordKey carried risk, and here it carried none.
  PUNCTUATION still diverges deliberately (analyzer also drops . - '), is NOT
  collision-tested, and the function comment says so. Re-measure before widening.

AUDITED CLEAN, do not re-investigate without new evidence:
  · Archive duplicates: 0 suspect groups, 0 extra rows across 40,867 rows. All
    1,635 multi-row groups are per-book, which is correct by design.
    Probe: snippets/2026-09-03_archive_dupes_readonly.js

*** TWO OF MY OWN LEADS WERE FALSE POSITIVES. Written up so nobody re-chases. ***
  1. "Ion Cutelaba duplicate archive row" — NOT a duplicate. Two `Fantasy` rows
     for one fighter+event are NORMAL: the line archiver writes Fantasy WITH a
     platform (the FP line), the heal writes Fantasy WITHOUT one (the result).
     A table omitting the platform column makes them look identical.
  2. "8 ungradeable placed legs (Orolbai x4, Su Mudaerji x4)" — NOT ungradeable.
     All 8 carry outcome hit/miss with actuals, resolved 08-16 and 08-29. My
     probe re-implemented the name matcher WITHOUT NAME_ALIASES, which already
     carries entries for both fighters (added 08-30) — and a comment in
     config/index.ts names these exact 8 legs.
  BOTH are the same mistake: a probe simplifying production's matching, or a
  table hiding the distinguishing column. See the corollary now recorded in
  [[feedback_test_inherited_premises]] — check the OUTCOME directly rather than
  re-deriving whether a match is possible, and grep the 49-entry alias map before
  writing up any name bug.

NOTED, NOT CHASED (no impact on Saturday, low value):
  · UFC 330 still exists in the archive under TWO event strings
    ('UFC 330: Makhachev vs. Machado Garry' 279 rows and 'UFC Fight Night: Ian
    Machado Garry vs …' 117 rows) — the documented shadow-row pair. It has
    already settled, so it is history, not risk. Same shape appears on the
    Hernandez cards.
  · This weekend's card is archived as 'UFC Fight Night: Dan Hooker vs Salahdine
    Parnasse' while upcoming_ufc_card.event reads 'UFC Fight Night: Hooker vs.
    Parnasse'. ONE spelling in the archive, so no shadow pair — but that is the
    precondition shape, worth a glance if grading looks odd after the card.

RESUMING FRIDAY 2026-09-04/05. UFC Paris (Hooker vs. Parnasse) is Saturday.
Everything from the 09-01 session is SHIPPED, PUSHED and VERIFIED - nothing is
half-done. There is exactly ONE blocked task waiting and it unblocks Friday.

*** FIRST MOVE: THE BEST PICKS AUDIT. ***
  It was blocked all of 09-01 because only SS lines were posted. Full props
  (TD / R1 SS / CTRL / FP) land FRIDAY - see [[feedback_audit_timing_full_props_friday]].
  BEFORE AUDITING:
    1. AUTO-FETCH LINES, then confirm the board actually has TD + R1 SS + CTRL +
       FP, not just SS. If any are missing it is still too early - do not audit.
    2. GENERATE PREDICTIONS. The stored board is from 09-01 03:39 and the lines
       will have moved all week. MODEL v44 is current; the panel chip must say v44.
    3. THEN invoke the ufc-lean-audit skill. That is what it is for.

*** SECOND: THE v39 CHECK, WHICH HAS BEEN WAITING SINCE 08-29. ***
  calcSSLean's duration-normalised hit rate needs DK ROUND MARKETS and DK had
  posted nothing all week, so v39 has never actually fired in production. Once DK
  is in, look at Hooker's SS lean reason for the note "(N/24 scaled to ~Xm)".
  Present = the term fired. Absent = DK still is not resolving for his name.
  The EFFECT is already measured out-of-band (RAW 50% -> v39 67% on Hooker, and
  the reverse on short-priced fights: Bukauskas 54% -> 23%). Friday only has to
  confirm production matches. HOOKER ONLY - Parnasse is a debut and calcSSLean
  bails at history.length < 3, so he can never exercise it.

*** THIRD, AND ONLY AFTER THE CARD SETTLES: RUN 19. ***
  The next learning cycle will be the FIRST that is both line-trained (v40) and
  post-v41/v44. Every loop claim in this file is about CODE, not measured
  behaviour, until it exists. Re-run BOTH probes after settling:
    snippets/2026-09-01_learning_log_readonly.js   (SS)
    snippets/2026-09-01_fp_loop_readonly.js        (FP)
  What to look for: does mean effectiveDelta.ss flip POSITIVE (18 runs of history
  were negative), and does targetKind finally read line-open/line-close instead
  of 'none'? Also run the Learning Cycle in the right order -
  [[project_learning_cycle_workflow]]: load the NEXT slate's lines BEFORE
  absorbing the finished card.

BOARD STATE AT HANDOFF (2026-09-01 03:41): 28 fighters, MODEL v44, 40807 archive
records / 41 unresolved. Pick6 + Underdog SS only; Betr, PrizePicks and DK all
still WAITING. Lines were ~1.9h old and SLATE CHECK had drifted 68% -> 53%, which
is just staleness - re-fetch on Friday, do not read it as a defect.

MY PLACED: the 09-01 Underdog "Champions" 2-legger is recorded at its ENTRY lines
(Ruziboev UNDER 22.5, Page UNDER 31.5, placed 08-31 15:15) alongside the 4-leg
Pick6 slip. Both fighters are the same fight, both UNDER - that is POSITIVE
correlation and effectively one wager. Stake/payout are NOT stored; PlacedParlay
has no such field.

--- WHAT IS CLOSED. DO NOT RE-DERIVE ANY OF THIS. ---
 * anchorShift sign: FIXED and VERIFIED in MODEL v44. Details below.
 * The book lines are ALL REAL - 12/12 against the live Pick6 board.
 * FOUR of my own hypotheses were retracted after measurement on 09-01: the "+12
   raw bias" (selection bias - measured only anchored rows), "books are 5x
   tighter" (built on excluding two rows that turned out to be real lines), the
   SS ratchet (dead on timing AND the trajectory ran the opposite way), and FP's
   long-running corruption (dead on timing again). All four are written up as
   RETRACTIONS in the 09-01 section. Read them before re-proposing any of them.
 * STANDING RULE: check the SHIP DATE before building a story about long-running
   corruption. That check killed two stories on 09-01, both times only after the
   reasoning had already been written down.
 * The raw SS estimator has a MAGNITUDE problem, not a side problem (direction
   agrees with normalised history on 6/8). Do NOT hunt for a bias fix inside
   predictSS, and do not expect a single multiplicative term to fix a spread.

(B) OTHERWISE: THE ARCHIVE FP INVESTIGATION. 81 archive Fantasy rows disagree with
    FP recomputed from UFCStats components. This is the biggest open thread in
    the project right now and it is NOT a ledger problem - the archive feeds
    grading, calibration, FP hit rates and CLV. See the section below; the FIRST
    move is already identified and is cheap.

THE GLOW-UP LADDER IS DONE (354-360 shipped, 357 REVERTED as 361). Do not
re-open it. Remaining ledger ideas are at the bottom; none are required.

THE UI WORK IS DONE FOR NOW (362-367, 2026-08-31). The clipping sweep is MINED
OUT - do not re-run it as a source of work. The design system pass (365-367) is
also at a natural stop. Both are written up at the bottom, along with the
measurement traps they walked into, which are the reusable part.

  master                  61918a9

=== MY PLACED LEDGER IS NOW AUDITED. IT IS CLEAN. ===
The "144 legs, YOU 76/144, BOARD 38/80, still NOT audited" line that rode in
this checkpoint for many sessions is CLOSED. All 144 legs re-graded against the
current archive with a faithful replay of resolveVsArchive:
  agree 136 | DISAGREE 0 | unmatched 8 | total 144, stored hits 76
The 8 unmatched were the REPLAY's own missing NAME_ALIASES (Myktybek Orolbai ->
...Uulu, the Sumudaerji family), not defects. YOU 76/144 is trustworthy.

ALL 144 legs are FROZEN verdicts (unpersisted 0). GLOW-UP 174 uses a persisted
rec.outcome verbatim and never re-resolves, so resolver fixes cannot reach them.
The re-grade proves they agree anyway - latent, not live.

=== SHIPPED (354-360), PLUS ONE REVERT (361) ===
354 BOARD chip tooltip: it is the closing BEST PICKS shortlist (<=8 OVER + <=8
    UNDER, one pick per fight, dedupeNegCorrelatedSameFight ~9567), NOT "the
    board's full suggested slate". Confirmed in storage: overs 8 / unders 8.
355 Header says BOARD top-16 and explains why YOU (every leg placed, 29-46 per
    event) and BOARD (16 per event) are NOT like-for-like. SELECTION below IS.
356 Drift marker on frozen actual values that no longer match the archive.
357 REVERTED - see the next section. Do not re-apply it.
358 BY BOOK / BY STAT breakdown strips, with a 1.5 SE bar before any cell takes
    a side (the GLOW-UP 310 rule). Everything currently reads FLAT.
359 Fighter search on BOTH ledgers, matching in CSS, both corners per row.
360 Concentration chip on the event head: "N FIGHTS - MAX M".

=== 357 WAS WRONG AND IS REVERTED. THE ARCHIVE IS NOT UNIFORMLY RIGHT. ===
357 displayed the archive's value on any drifted leg. It was built on TWO SS
cases where UFCStats agreed with the archive. It did not generalise. PER STAT:
  SS drifts -> ARCHIVE right (Douglas 7/14/14, Mederos 110/73/73).
  FP drifts -> STORED right, ARCHIVE WRONG. UFCStats components compute 117.5
    (Fantasy) / 66 (PP) on all three Makhachev rows, matching stored; the
    archive reads 127.5 / 76 - exactly +10 in BOTH scoring systems.
The ledger now MARKS the disagreement and picks NEITHER side; the archive's
number is named in the tooltip. DO NOT re-apply 357 on SS evidence alone - that
is precisely the reasoning that produced it.

=== (B) THE ARCHIVE FP INVESTIGATION - OPEN, AND THE BIGGEST THREAD ===
81 archive Fantasy/Fantasy_PP rows disagree with FP recomputed from UFCStats
components. Histogram is dominated by -5 (Fantasy, 19 rows), then -10 (8), with
a long one-off tail. The -5 cluster sits on THREE-ROUND DECISIONS and appears on
LOSSES as well as wins, so it is NOT a win-bonus effect. Mechanism UNKNOWN.

*** ONE MECHANISM IS NOW NAILED: THE ARCHIVE INTERMITTENTLY MISSES REVERSALS ***
28 of the 81 (35%) are EXACTLY -5 x rev; recomputing with rev forced to 0 gives
delta 0 on every one. rev 1 -> -5, rev 2 -> -10, rev 3 -> -15.
THE DISCRIMINATOR was scoring, not value: reversal is 5 in FANTASY and 0 in
PRIZEPICKS, so a missing reversal hits Fantasy rows ONLY. A missing TAKEDOWN
would hit both (5 and 5). The -5 cluster is 100% Fantasy, never Fantasy_PP.
INTERMITTENT, NOT SYSTEMATIC: 432 rows have rev>0 and only 28 are wrong (~93%
correct). NOT a code-path cutover either: clean before 2022-10, then misses
scatter to 2026-07 interleaved with clean months (2026-04 8/0, 2026-05 6/0,
2026-08 7/0), and they appear in BOTH settled and backfilled rows.
*** 2026-09-02: THAT "UNTESTED NEXT STEP" IS DEAD AT THE PREMISE. ***
It said fightHistory comes from the FIGHTER page and the settle path from the
FIGHT DETAIL page, and wanted a live fetch to compare them. There is nothing to
compare. parseFightHistoryLinks (analyzer/parsers.ts:42) pushes ONLY
{result, opponent, event, method, round, date, fightUrl} - no rev, no kd, no
sigStr, no statistics at all. The fighter page never supplies a reversal, so
fightHistory.rev can only come from parseFightDetailStats. Both candidate
sources read the SAME page at the SAME column 8 (parsers.ts:160 and
background.ts:727 carry identical column maps). DO NOT SPEND A FETCH ON THIS.

THE REAL QUESTION: archivePerformanceForRosterFighter (analyzer.ts ~26325)
computes the STORED FP from ufcData.fightHistory - the same object the audit
recomputes from. So this was never two sources disagreeing; it is ONE source
disagreeing with ITSELF across time. ufcstats_v51_* expires every ~24-32h and
re-parses every fight detail, so the question is what makes a field unstable
across refetches.

=== MEASURED 2026-09-02 (probe v2, 50 disagreeing Fantasy rows) ===
  27 explained EXACTLY by 5 x cache rev (rev 1 -> -5, rev 2 -> -10, rev 3 -> -15).
     Stored was computed with rev=0; the cache now carries rev>0.
  *** SS AND TD AGREE ON ALL 27. The entry was NOT rewritten. ***
     Of the 27: 17 have CTRL agreeing too (rev moved ALONE),
                10 have CTRL differing (rev AND ctrl moved).
     sigStr and td NEVER drift on any of them.

  THE COLUMN PATTERN IS THE LEAD. In parseFightDetailStats the map is
     kd=1  sigStr=2  totStr=4  td=5  sub=7  REV=8  CTRL=9
  The only two fields that ever drift are the LAST TWO columns. Everything at a
  lower index is stable. That is a much narrower target than "the parse is wrong".
  CAVEAT, AND IT MATTERS: a simple "the row came back truncated" story does NOT
  fit cleanly, because ctrl SURVIVES on 17 of the 27. Col 8 can move without col
  9 moving. Do not assume truncation; that is the next thing to test, not a
  conclusion.

  AND IT EXPLAINS THE Fantasy-ONLY DISCRIMINATOR COMPLETELY. PRIZEPICKS_SCORING
  has reversal: 0 AND controlTimePerSec: 0 (config/index.ts:147). Losing cols 8-9
  is INVISIBLE to Fantasy_PP by construction. The checkpoint's "-5 cluster is
  100% Fantasy, never Fantasy_PP" was never about reversals specifically - it is
  about the trailing columns, and reversal is just the one that shows up most.

=== THE RESIDUAL IS NOW LARGELY EXPLAINED TOO ===
Of the other 23 rows: ~15 are sub-0.1 rounding noise (one-second ctrl differences
at 0.03/sec) and should be filtered out of any future run. The remaining ~8 are
OUTCOME-field drift - method / round / timeSecs / kd - and every delta maps
exactly onto a scoring constant:
    -60  = 90 (R1 win) - 30 (decision)     stored had the decision bonus
    +15  = 45 (R3 win) - 30 (decision)
    -25  = quickWinBonus (R1 finish <=60s)
    +10  = knockdown
*** THE MAKHACHEV +10 IS A KNOCKDOWN. *** The checkpoint listed it as
unexplained and noted that a knockdown and the win bonus "each add exactly 10 to
both scoring systems, so the Makhachev +10 cannot discriminate them". True by
value - but the WHOLE-ROW recompute pins it: with kd forced to match the cache
the row reconciles, and the win-bonus tiers produce 60/15/25, not 10. That
hypothesis was retired too early.

=== *** VERIFIED AGAINST THE SOURCE: THE CACHE IS RIGHT, THE ARCHIVE IS STALE *** ===
This had been ASSUMED for several sessions, never checked. Now checked. Fetched
the live Davis vs Ziam fight page (UFC FN: Adesanya vs. Imavov) with a standalone
PoW-solving fetcher:
    col 8 (Rev.)   Fares Ziam = 2    Mike Davis = 3
which is exactly what the CACHE holds. The archive row was computed with rev=0.
So the archive is the stale side. Direction settled.
  ALSO: that page parses cleanly TODAY - 10 <td>s, every column carrying exactly
  two <p>s including col 8. There is no structural anomaly in the Rev cell.
  TOOL: scripts/ufcstats-fetch-cli.mjs (node, solves the PoW, read-only GETs).

=== FOUR HYPOTHESES DEAD. ALL FOUR KILLED BY DATA, NOT ARGUMENT. ===
 1. FIGHTER PAGE vs DETAIL PAGE - dead at the premise. parseFightHistoryLinks
    supplies no rev at all.
 2. TRAILING-RANGE LOSS (cols 8+9 together) - dead. Col 7 (`sub`) is STABLE:
    14 affected rows carry sub > 0, Fantasy_PP reconciles exactly on 25/27, and
    ZERO are off by 4 x sub. One cell, not a range.
 3. OPPONENT-CELL FALLBACK (`|| tds[col][0]`) - dead. The 22/27 "match" was BASE
    RATE; most fights carry rev 0 on both sides, where "read the opponent" and
    "read nothing" are identical. On the ONLY 5 rows where it was testable -
    opponent rev non-zero - the stored value is 0, not the opponent's 2/2/1/2/2.
    And in all 5, the OPPONENT's own row is CORRECT.
 4. WRITER (settle's filter-shift vs backfill) - dead. Affected rows are 89%
    backfill against a 90% backfill BASE RATE. The writer tracks the base rate
    exactly, so it is not the discriminator.
  METHOD NOTE WORTH KEEPING: 2 and 3 were only readable because the probe named
  its own weak spot in advance ("a high match rate here is mostly base rate; it
  is evidence only where the opponent rev is non-zero"). The raw 22/27 would have
  read as confirmation. Build the base-rate comparison BEFORE running.

=== SO THE MECHANISM IS: A HISTORICAL rev=0 WINDOW THAT NEVER HEALED ===
The stored value was ABSENT and defaulted to 0 - not misread, not the opponent's.
The cache has since been refetched correctly. What is left is a residue of rows
written during a window when the cached rev was 0.

*** WHY IT PERSISTS, AND WHY FORCE BACKFILL WILL NOT FIX IT ***
  PropArchiveService.updateResult OVERWRITES unconditionally (`row.result = ...`)
  but only touches EXISTING rows - it returns false when there is no candidate.
  It is driven by archivePerformanceForRosterFighter, which early-returns unless
  the fighter is on the CURRENT ROSTER. So rows heal only while their fighter is
  on an upcoming card; everyone else keeps the stale number indefinitely.
  FORCE BACKFILL DOES NOT HELP: it runs backfillUnresolvedFromKnownOutcomes,
  which fills rows whose result is NULL. These 27 already hold a (wrong) result,
  so they are invisible to it.

=== THE ONE THING LEFT, AND IT IS NARROW ===
Morgan Charriere is on the CURRENT Paris roster and is still affected. If the
heal worked he should have been rewritten on any board load since. So either the
heal is not firing for him, or normalizeEvent is failing to match his row. That
is the next question - and it is now about the HEAL path, not the parse.
  Suggested first move: instrument or dump, for one affected roster fighter,
  whether updateResult finds a candidate row for that event at all.

=== WHAT IS STILL OPEN ===
Why do cols 8-9 drift while 1-5 do not, and why can col 8 move without col 9?
That is the remaining question and it is now narrow enough to be answerable.
TOOL: snippets/2026-09-02_archive_fp_rev_probe.js (read-only, v2).
  v1 of that probe INVENTED the pick6 scoring constants (sigStrike 0.5 vs the
  real 0.4, ctrl 0.0083 vs 0.03, a flat 30 win bonus, quickWinBonus omitted) and
  reported 2270 false disagreements. v2 mirrors calcFPForPlatform exactly and was
  FUZZ-VERIFIED against the real implementation imported from dist/ - 4000 cases,
  zero mismatches - and now refuses to interpret anything if the agree rate falls
  below 90%. NEVER hand-transcribe a scoring table again; import it or fuzz it.

THE PLATFORM SPLIT WAS RUN AND WAS NOT THE ANSWER: SETTLED 340 compared / 19
disagree (6%); BACKFILLED 4185 / 62 (1%). Neither path is broadly broken.

TWO HYPOTHESES TESTED, BOTH FAILED - do not re-run them:
  (a) a miscounted knockdown; (b) the round-vs-decision win bonus. Neither is
  separable by VALUE anyway: each adds exactly 10 to both scoring systems, so
  the Makhachev +10 cannot discriminate them. The aggregate histogram matches
  neither prediction (predicted +15 Fantasy / +20 PP for 3R decisions; observed
  -5 dominant).

*** FIRST MOVE NEXT TIME ***
The platform split HAS been run (see above - it was not the answer) and the
reversal mechanism HAS been found. What is left is the 53-row residual and the
question of WHY reversals are missed intermittently. The one untested lead is
that fightHistory is parsed from the FIGHTER page while the settle path parses
the FIGHT DETAIL page; compare the two sources for one known-missed fight.
That needs a live UFCStats fetch, so it is not a five-minute job.

THE LIVE SCORER IS NOT THE BUG. The settle log reconciles by hand: Sumudaerji
SS=41 CTRL=0.23min W R3 over a 15.00min fight -> FP 70.6, which only works with
the DECISION bonus (16.4 + nonSig*0.2 + 0.41 + 30), and FP_PP 50.5 likewise.
So these are HISTORICAL writes. Note "re-applied N results" in the settle log
re-applies STORED results; it does NOT re-derive them from components.

WHY IT MATTERS BEYOND THE LEDGER: the archive feeds grading, calibration, the FP
hit rates and CLV. Nine ledger rows were the symptom, not the disease.

=== TWO MORE HYPOTHESES THAT DIED THIS SESSION - DO NOT RE-DERIVE ===
1. "boardStatsFor reads a field that does not exist (p.line / p.platform)."
   WRONG. TWO snapshot stores with DIFFERENT field names:
     best_picks_snapshots_v1 - picks carry date, line, platform. THIS is what
       boardStatsFor and the selection/ALPHA diagnostics read (~15557).
     ai_lean_snapshots_v1    - picks carry capturedAt, activeLine,
       activePlatform, and NO date/line/platform at all.
   Its Date.parse(s.date) collapse is CORRECT for its store. The house rule
   about collapseSnapshotsByEvent does NOT apply to the ledger. CHECK WHICH
   STORE BEFORE DIAGNOSING - this cost three wrong diagnoses in one session.
2. "archiveIdx first-row-wins over duplicate rows causes the drift." WRONG, and
   it was queued as priority 1. A key event|fighter|propType legitimately holds
   ONE ROW PER BOOK - same result, different line - so first-row-wins is
   harmless. All 32 rows behind the 9 drifts agree with each other and disagree
   with the frozen value. Do NOT change archiveIdx on a dupRows correlation.

=== UFCSTATS CACHE SHAPE (cost FOUR wrong joins - do not guess it again) ===
key ufcstats_v51_<name_lower_underscored>; top level is
{careerStats, detailUrl, fetchedAt, fightHistory, name}.
  - the array is **fightHistory**, NOT history
  - each entry's opponent field is **opponent**, NOT opp
  - date is human format ("Aug. 22, 2026"), NOT ISO - slicing it against an ISO
    date never matches. Join on evKeyOf(entry.event) instead.
  - entries carry sigStr/sigStrR1/sigStrBody/sigStrLeg/td/kd/ctrlSecs/sub/rev/
    totStr/timeSecs/round/method/result - and NO fp. FP must be recomputed via
    calcFPForPlatform (src/analyzer/fantasy-scoring.ts).
  - method is short form ('U-DEC', 'S-DEC', 'KO/TKO'), not the fight-page wording
Caches can be STALE: Kaue Fernandes held 4 fights ending Sep 2025, so his Aug
2026 bout was simply absent.

=== LESSONS THIS SESSION RE-TAUGHT ===
- DO NOT GENERALISE FROM TWO DATA POINTS. 357 shipped on two SS cases and was
  contradicted by the FP check within the hour. If a rule is about to drive
  DISPLAY logic, test it on every stat it will touch first.
- MEASUREMENT PROVES GEOMETRY, NOT OCCLUSION (the 348 lesson, again). The first
  drift marker appended a glyph after the value. .plg-actual is nowrap in a
  fixed track, so the extra width did not overflow the ROW - the left neighbour
  painted over the text and "actual 110" rendered "ual 110". scrollWidth never
  moved; a screenshot caught it. Fix was a ZERO-WIDTH signal (class +
  border-bottom + title). SIBLING OVERLAP *IS* measurable if you compare EDGES
  (kids[i].right > kids[i+1].left) - reuse that on any dense-grid change.
- A CELL MUST NOT TAKE A SIDE IT CANNOT SUPPORT (358, per GLOW-UP 310's 1.5 SE
  bar).
- COMMIT MESSAGES GO TO A FILE. git commit -m with backticks let bash
  command-substitute them and silently ate words. Use git commit -F.
- BASH HEREDOCS CONTAINING QUOTES BREAK THIS TOOL OUTRIGHT, even quoted ones.
  Two attempts died at the same line. Write the file with the Write tool.
- A python heredoc that does not CLOSE the file may not flush. Use with-blocks.

=== WHAT THE BREAKDOWN SAYS (nothing is actionable yet) ===
BY BOOK  PICK6 27/54 50% | UNDERDOG 24/43 56% | BETR 9/22 41% | DK 9/14 64% |
         PRIZEPICKS 7/11 64%
BY STAT  FP 28/55 51% | SS 23/44 52% | R1 SS 15/22 68% | TD 4/11 36% |
         CTRL 3/7 43% | KD 2/4 50% | FT 1/1 100%
NOT ONE separates from the 53% overall at 1.5 SE. Watch R1 SS (best cell, 1.4
SE, nearly there). Pick6 carries 54 of 144 legs at exactly 50% - largest
exposure on the weakest non-thin book. Do NOT act on Betr 41%; it is the cell
most likely to tempt a change and has the least support.
CONCENTRATION: 7 legs on ONE fight on the Nurmagomedov card (16% of it).

=== REMAINING LEDGER IDEAS (none started, none required) ===
- Per-event P/L was DELIBERATELY SKIPPED at rung 4: pick-em legs are not
  independently priced, so 1u-per-leg P/L is hits-minus-misses restated. Needs
  stake entry, which changes how legs are RECORDED, not just displayed.
- The CONFLICT CHIP is still unimplemented and LINE-BLIND.
- The 2-row archive-audit residue: platform x stat sums to 423 not 425.

################################################################################
##  2026-08-31 SESSION - UI CLIPPING + THE DWCS CHECK                          ##
################################################################################

BOARD STATE AT HANDOFF: Paris props are only PARTIALLY in. Underdog has FT lines
(13 archived, "Partial - 13 lines"); Pick6, Betr, PrizePicks and DK Sportsbook
all still WAITING. 28 fighters, 6 actionable leans, TOP EDGE Michael Page
FT-OVER, 11 unresolved records. Gate 2 may already be satisfiable - its bar is
>=1 pick with a lean AND a finite activeLine, not full coverage - but the Best
Picks audit still needs TD + R1 SS + CTRL + FP.

=== THE DWCS OVERLAP: CHECKED, AND THERE IS NO CONTAMINATION ===
Underdog captured 23 names, ~10 of them OFF-CARD (Patrick Rivera, Adam Darby,
Modestino Rodrigues, Brandon Holmes, Adam Livingston, Hunter Smith, Silvestre
Sanchez, Liam McCracken, Charlie Cleveland, Gabriel Lourenco). Only the 13
ON-ROSTER fighters reached the archive, matching the "13 archived" chip. ZERO
DWCS rows carry a UFC event name. DWCS results archive under their own label
("DWCS 8.3", results, no lines). That is the desired split - keep the data, skip
the fight card - and it is ALREADY the behaviour. Do not "fix" it.
lines_underdog shape is {capturedAt, fighters:[...]}; entries carry
name/opponent/line_*/*_avail/*_odds and NO promotion or slate field, so any
attribution rule would have to be roster-based, not source-based.

METHOD TRAP: the ghost detector reported 1 ghost and the true count was 0. It
compared a DOM-scraped roster name against an archive name WITHOUT
alias-normalising either side, so "Matthieu Letho Duclos" (UD) looked off-card
against "Matthieu Duclos" (roster). ALIAS-NORMALISE BOTH SIDES or a sweep
invents contamination.

That variant WAS a real latent bug for a different reason, now fixed (2a7044e):
namesMatch is surname-token based so archiving worked, but resolveVsArchive uses
an EXACT event|normalizedName|propType key - a leg placed on "Matthieu Duclos"
would never have found a row filed under "Matthieu Letho Duclos". Same shape as
the 8 legs (Orolbai, Sumudaerji) the 08-30 audit could not re-grade.

=== THE CLIPPING SWEEP: WHAT IT PRODUCED, AND ITS ONE BIG MISTAKE ===
*** MEASUREMENT TRAP - READ BEFORE ANY LAYOUT WORK ***
Every measurement in the first half of this session was taken at 827px, with
DevTools DOCKED beside the page. That is UNDER the 1100px breakpoint and NOT a
width this board is ever used at (normal use is ~1707px, DevTools closed).
It caused a defect to be flagged that does not exist in normal use, and caused
a real one to be both oversold and then undersold. UNDOCK DEVTOOLS (its menu ->
Dock side -> undock) before any layout sweep, or the results describe a layout
nobody sees.

362 pred-factor - REAL, the big one. v41's "Book calibration: ..." reason was
    registered in NEITHER table that owns chip rendering: FACTOR_SHORT had no
    rule so compressFactor fell through to `return r` and rendered the whole
    sentence (326px over, on 28 chips), and FACTOR_LANES had no matching test
    (^Book prior does not cover ^Book calibration) so it drew with NO lane class
    and was absent from the legend. BOTH tables match the RAW reason. Now
    compressed to "BCAL 71->78.5" and joined to the existing pf-cal lane.
    THE TWO-TABLE TRAP IS REAL - a new reason string needs an entry in both.
363 pf-vs - REAL but small. It was one nowrap+ellipsis run of
    "vs {opponent} - {rounds}R", so overflow ate the TAIL: the round count,
    which drives 5R/3R inference and v39's duration-normalised hit-rate term.
    Now an inline-flex with a shrinkable .pf-vs-name and a flex:0 0 auto
    .pf-vs-r. Still 11 rows clipping at full width - by design; the name
    truncates and the marker survives. No child-count change (the 347 rule).
364 bias-platform - REAL. Printed the raw storage key DRAFTKINGS_SPORTSBOOK.
    Fixed with a TRANSFORM, deliberately not a sixth lookup table:
    BP_SLATE_BOOK_ABBR, BOOK_ABBR, BOOK_NAME, BP_BOOK_SHORT and BP_BOOK_FULL are
    already five copies of the same book-label map.
fighter-name - NON-ISSUE. Its truncation lives only inside
    @media (max-width: 1100px) with max-width 260px. No cap above that, and the
    board is used at ~1707px. Do not "fix" it.
pred-gen - FALSE POSITIVE. The sweep reported 196px; it does not reproduce.
    vOverflow is 0, scrollW/clientW differ by 19px of phantom trailing advance
    (padding 5px 14px + letter-spacing 0.44px), and the label renders in full.

THE SWEEP IS SPENT. Down to phantom 19px readings and enum labels. If you want
more UI, pick it from something annoying in daily use, not another sweep.

################################################################################
##  2026-08-31 PM - THE DESIGN SYSTEM PASS (365-367)                           ##
################################################################################

feature/sleek-theme-v1 a1dbd48 | master ce42c13 | full parity, tree clean.

365  COMMAND HUD over the header + both filter bars. NO new palette - the tokens
     already in the sheet were the brief (--bg near-black navy, --gold, --cyan
     mint, --green, --red, --text3). Status pills became ONE bounded cluster;
     AUTO-FETCH LINES became the primary CTA at 14.02:1 with a CONTAINED glow;
     REFRESH/MORE demoted to ghosts; four-state status set with a pulse that
     fires ONLY when live (a pulse on a dead feed is a lie); tab bar unified with
     an underline active state rather than a fill, because a filled tab competes
     with the CTA. Search placeholder fixed, operators preserved on the title.
365b SCANLINE at 0.15. Safe to push ~9x because it paints at z-index 0 with all
     children at 1 - it never overlays text, so it costs nothing in contrast.
     PICKED BY LOOKING: a 1px line at a 3px period blurs toward flat grey on a
     HiDPI panel, so the value is a property of the display, not the CSS. Stepped
     0.045/0.075/0.11/0.15/0.20 live. Retune the same way, do not reason at it.
366  ONE RADIUS SCALE. Measured four radii on one screen - .header 12, .filter-bar
     10, slate row 8, eight fighter panels 14 - and TWO were introduced by 365.
     The pass meant to unify the chrome had added a fourth dialect to a board
     that already had a coherent one. So the chrome YIELDED to the board:
     --r-panel 14px / --r-inset 8px, and .header/.filter-bar adopt 14. Changed my
     two surfaces instead of eight-plus, and stayed out of .fighter-main.
     Also: .fighter-header-row measured border 0 / radius 0 - the only major
     surface with neither - and got a BASELINE RULE, not a panel (it spans full
     width; a border and corners would read as a card wedged under the bar).
     Also: TABULAR FIGURES, 40 -> 0. Verified by rendering "111" vs "000" at 40px:
     Space Grotesk 54.3/77.8, Sora 51.4/91.6, JetBrains Mono 72.0/72.0.
367  HERO TILES equal height. TOP EDGE has no .mh-meter so it measured 86px
     against 100px - exactly the meter's footprint (6px + 1px margins + the 6px
     flex gap). Fixed by stretching the row, NOT by a 14px shim (magic number)
     and NOT by giving it a gauge ("+40%" is unbounded - inventing a scale to
     tidy a layout is inventing data). Also caught a FIFTH radius: .mh-stat at
     10px, now on the inset step.

=== THE REUSABLE PART: MEASUREMENT OVERRULED THE PLAN FOUR TIMES ===
Every one of these was a confident read that the numbers reversed. Expect the
same next time and measure first.
 1. "Extend the chrome down onto the board." BACKWARDS. The board already had a
    language (8 of 9 panels at 14px); my pass had disrupted it. The fix was to
    ADOPT, not impose.
 2. "Don't put tabular-nums in the dense fighter cards, it will cause clipping."
    UNFOUNDED. Applied live to all 41 and re-measured: clipped 0 before, 0 after,
    29 grew, widest growth 7px. The caution was right to have and wrong to keep.
 3. "75-110px of dead vertical space in the chrome." INFLATED. Exactly ONE gap
    over 24px (54px), total chrome before the first metric 222px, and NO empty
    containers. Dropped as not worth doing. The 54px has no identified cause -
    neither neighbour has margins - if anyone cares enough to look.
 4. "The hero trend line rides up inside its tile." WRONG CAUSE, right complaint.
    The tiles distribute correctly internally; the tile itself was smaller. The
    wrong cause would have produced a hand-tuned shim.

=== TWO RULES THAT EARNED THEIR KEEP TODAY ===
 * UNDOCK DEVTOOLS BEFORE ANY LAYOUT SWEEP. Docked beside the page it puts the
   board at 827px, UNDER the 1100px breakpoint, which is not a width this app is
   used at (normal is ~1707px). It made me flag fighter-name as broken when it
   is not, and both oversell and then undersell pf-vs.
 * CHECK A NUMBER THAT SHOULD MOVE. The first tabular-nums block left prose as
   raw text between a stray */ and the real one; the parser discarded through the
   rule. It survived a reload looking fine. What exposed it was the check
   reporting "still proportional: 40 (was 40)" - unchanged after a change that
   should have moved it. Verifying only the things that DID work would have
   shipped a dead rule. Same shape as c776f26.

=== SMALL AND OPEN (neither is required) ===
 - The 54px gap after .filter-bar-top has no identified cause.
 - Fighter cards look empty on the right, but that is likely PARTIAL-DATA state
   (only UD FT lines are in) and may fill in when props land. Do not treat a
   partial board as a layout problem.
 - .fighter-main is the remaining big surface. It is also the one this repo has
   broken before by editing ahead of a browser check - test in the browser FIRST.


################################################################################
##  2026-09-01 - GATE 2 CLOSED, v43 BOARD REGENERATED, AND THE ANCHOR SIGN     ##
################################################################################

BOARD STATE: UFC Fight Night: Hooker vs. Parnasse, 28 fighters, MODEL v43,
regenerated 2026-09-01 ~01:55. 40807 archive records, 41 unresolved.
LINES IN: Pick6 and Underdog SS only. Betr, PrizePicks and DK Sportsbook all
still WAITING. No TD / FP / CTRL / R1 SS book lines anywhere on the board.

=== GATE 2: CLOSED ===
  event: UFC Fight Night: Hooker vs. Parnasse
  picks: 9 | carrying displayedConfidence: 9 | recalibrationReady: true
All nine picks carry the field and the raw->displayed deltas are non-zero, so
initRecalibrationMap is populating and the stored number IS the displayed one.
This is the first card where the graded number and the shown number are the same
thing (240fe65). Gate 3 grades it after Paris settles.

=== (4) THE v39 5R CHECK: CANNOT BE RUN YET, AND HALF OF IT NEVER CAN ===
This was the "eyeball Hooker/Parnasse for v39" item. The answer is that v39 is
DORMANT on this board, for two independent reasons - neither of which is a bug.

  v39 IS GATED BEHIND DK, NOT BEHIND THE 5R INFERENCE. calcSSLean's hit-rate
  term calls marketExpectedFightMinutes(name, schedRounds) (analyzer.ts ~5680).
  That function needs resolveRoundStartFromMap / resolveDistanceDecisionProb /
  finishHistogramConditional, and ALL THREE read dk*ByName maps - DK Sportsbook
  is the only source. DK has posted nothing. So expMinsSS is null, clearedSSLine
  falls back to the raw `ss > line_ss` comparison per fight, ssNormalisedFights
  stays 0 and the hrNote is empty. The normaliser is not running.
  durationAdjustProjection is gated on the same call, so the "Duration-adjusted"
  reason is absent for the same reason. Neither is a 5R problem.

  PARNASSE CAN NEVER EXERCISE v39. calcSSLean bails at `history.length < 3`
  before it ever reaches the hit-rate term, and Parnasse has NO UFCStats history
  (UFC debut - the board shows the no-history badge and the NO HISTORY chip).
  He gets no SS lean at all. Only the HOOKER side of this main event can ever
  test v39, and only once DK posts.

  WHAT IS CONFIRMED GOOD: the 5R inference itself. Hooker and Parnasse are the
  ONLY two rows marked 5R; all 26 others read 3R. That is exactly the headliner
  rule and it matches the event title, so getScheduledRoundsContext reached both
  the predictor and the lean path correctly.

  RE-RUN THE v39 CHECK ON FRIDAY, ON HOOKER ONLY, once DK is in. Look for the
  "(N/24 scaled to ~Xm)" note on his hit-rate reason - its presence is the proof
  the term fired; its absence means DK still is not resolving for his name.

  *** PARTIALLY ANSWERED ALREADY, 03:01, WITHOUT DK ***
  The hit-rate tool reproduces the v39 arithmetic using the PREDICTOR's
  career-based expMin instead of DK's market minutes, and the effect the original
  item predicted is real and large: Hooker RAW 12/24 = 50% -> v39 16/24 = 67%,
  the biggest upward move on the card, on the exact fighter named. It also cuts
  the other way harder than expected - Bukauskas 54% -> 23%, Pinto 50% -> 25% -
  because those fights are priced SHORT, so duration is a two-sided correction
  and not a 5R-main special case. Friday's DK run only needs to confirm that
  production v39 fires and lands near these figures; the mechanism is no longer
  in question.

=== *** THE v43 ANCHOR SHIFT IS NEGATED - CONFIRMED BY THE AUDIT, NOT FIXED *** ===
RUN 2026-09-01 02:26. 79 stat rows, 10 anchored (all SS - TD and R1 SS measure
S=0 so their anchor is inert, and no FP line is posted to anchor against).
MEASURED S: SS 3.3 | TD -0.0 | R1 SS 0 | FP -7.7.

  ON ALL 10 ANCHORED ROWS, fair = posted - 3.3, EXACTLY.
    Hooker fair 24.2 / book 27.5 | Ziam 35.2 / 38.5 | Sola 21.2 / 24.5
    Charriere 33.2 / 36.5 | Peek 21.2 / 24.5 | Campbell 21.2 / 24.5
    Cornolle 27.2 / 30.5 | Sygula 31.2 / 34.5 | Lima 32.2 / 35.5
    Parnasse 30.2 / 33.5
  `fair` is quoted verbatim in the stored reason and the book line comes from the
  RAW line store, which nothing in the anchor path writes. fair = posted + shift,
  so shift = -3.3 = -S. Confirmed, not inferred. calibrateToBooks then subtracts
  S a second time.

DO NOT FIX THE SIGN ON ITS OWN. See the next section - the negation is currently
compensating for something bigger, and correcting it alone makes the board worse.

  analyzer.ts ~14564:  const anchorShift = (stat) => -(bookCal?.global?.[stat] ?? 0);

  bookCal.global[stat] is (predicted - posted) - stated outright in
  expectedLineAtBook: "bias is (predicted - posted), so the posted number is
  predicted MINUS the bias". It is POSITIVE for SS (comment says 4.1; the
  PREDICTOR VS POSTED LINES panel currently reads SS bias +3.0, n=229).

  applyMarketAnchorFor computes `fair = postedLine + shift`, and it runs INSIDE
  the pair loop - so sp.line is still on the MODEL scale, uncalibrated.
  calibrateToBooks runs AFTER the loop and subtracts the same offset again.

  Let S = bookCal.global.SS > 0 and P = the posted line. Then:
    intended   shift = +S -> band after calibration = [P - cap, P + cap]
    as written shift = -S -> band after calibration = [P - 2S - cap, P - 2S + cap]
  With S ~ 3 and cap = max(6, 0.18*fair), an ANCHORED SS line can land anywhere
  from ~12 under the book to, at best, level with it. It is structurally
  incapable of finishing above the posted line. The offset is applied twice in
  the same direction.

  THE BOARD IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS. Of the 16 rows carrying a book SS line,
  15 sit at or below it and only ONE is above: Parnasse at +6.0 - and Parnasse's
  number is set by applyDebutMoneylineSplit, which v43 deliberately runs AFTER
  the anchor. The big unders are the anchored rows (Charriere -13.0,
  Ruziboev -10.0, Bukauskas -10.0, Sy -8.0, Pinto -6.0); the ten -1.0 rows are
  just calibrateToBooks removing a +3 bias from a board whose real gap is ~+2.5
  and snapping to the .5 grid. Those -1.0s are FINE. The tail is the question.

  THIS IS ONE DAY OLD. anchorShift arrived with v43 SUGGESTION 2 (2026-08-30);
  this is the first board generated under it with book lines present, so nothing
  settled has ever been priced this way. FP is NOT affected - it uses
  computeMarketFpShift, a different quantity, applied consistently as
  `fair = book + fpShift` in both the anchor and the display.

  BEFORE CHANGING IT: this is a numbers claim reconstructed from the code plus
  a screenshot of the board, not from instrumented output. Confirm S and confirm
  which rows actually carry an `anchoredFrom` field before touching the sign -
  the house rule is verify by numbers, and "13 of 16 negative" is a correlation.
  THE CONFIRMATION IS ALREADY WRITTEN AND IS READ-ONLY:
    snippets/2026-09-01_anchor_sign_readonly_audit.js
  Paste it in the ANALYZER page console. It only calls chrome.storage.local.get.
  It recovers the posted line from the stored REASON STRINGS rather than from the
  line stores - the anchor reason carries `fair` and `cap`, the calibration reason
  carries the measured offset S, so P = fair + S - and then cross-checks that
  against the raw stores as an independent column. Verdict logic was dry-run in
  node against fabricated boards and correctly separates "consistent with the
  sign error" from "one anchored row finished ABOVE the book, drop the claim".
  IF NOTHING IS ANCHORED, the script says so and the claim stays UNPROVEN - the
  band argument only bites when applyMarketAnchorFor actually fires.

=== *** RETRACTED: "THE RAW SS PREDICTOR RUNS ~+12 ABOVE POSTED LINES" *** ===
THAT NUMBER WAS SELECTION BIAS AND IT IS WRONG. It was the median of
(anchoredFrom - book) over the ANCHORED rows only - and the anchor fires PRECISELY
on the rows where the model disagrees most. Conditioning on "the anchor fired" and
then measuring disagreement measures the selection, not the model. Textbook, and I
walked straight into it.

WHAT THE CLEAN DECOMPOSITION SAYS (2026-09-01 02:48, 28/28 chain intact,
zero formula mismatches, 9 rows carrying a usable single-book line):
  median raw-book   +7.5   (the estimator's own error)
  median final-book -1.0   (what the learner sees)

  DO NOT QUOTE +7.5 AS A BIAS. It is unstable: drop the two rows whose BOOK is
  suspect (Hooker +24.5 at ratio 0.45, Peek +8.0 at 0.55) and the median falls to
  -3.0. What is stable is the SPREAD, and it is enormous:
      raw-book   -12, -11, -5, -3, +7.5, +8, +21, +24.5, +25.5   IQR 26
      final-book -15, -10, -8, -6, -1, -1, -1, 0, +3             IQR  7
  THE ANCHOR IS A CLAMP, NOT A CALIBRATION. It compresses the IQR from 26 to 7 -
  location AND spread - and the clamped result is what runLearningCycle reads.
  A single multiplicative ss_pace_modifier cannot fix a variance problem, so
  "retune the pace term" was never the answer.

  ss_pace_modifier IS NOT SATURATED either, which was the other thing I expected:
  default 1.056, bantam 1.032, feather 0.972, heavy 0.888, FLY 1.275 - all well
  inside [0.70, 1.40] and mostly ABOVE 1.0. The learner is not straining downward.
  That is consistent with the broken loop below - it is not straining at all.

  S IS STILL THE PIPELINE'S RESIDUAL, NOT THE MODEL'S. bookCalibration measures
  (predicted - posted) on STORED predictions, i.e. after anchoring and calibration.
  That part of the earlier note stands and is worth keeping.

=== *** WHERE THE DISPERSION COMES FROM: THE 50/50 OPPONENT BLEND *** ===
predictSS is  ((fighterRate + oppRate) / 2) * expectedMin * ssMod * style.
oppRate is the OPPONENT'S ABSORBED rate (SAPM), weighted EQUALLY with the
fighter's own output rate. Score each row against the fighter's OWN career-rate
expectation (career SS/min x this fight's expectedMin - an independent reference
from UFCStats, not from any book):

   fighter      own   opp   opp/own   raw    careerExp   raw/careerExp
   Cornolle    2.73  5.50    2.01    56.0      34.2          1.64
   Ziam        2.68  4.53    1.69    46.0      36.2          1.27

  MONOTONIC IN opp/own. That is partly ARITHMETIC, not discovery - by construction
  raw - careerExp ~ expectedMin x (opp - own)/2 - so do NOT present it as a
  correlation finding. The DESIGN question is what matters: is a 50/50 weight
  right? The books say no.

  *** THE "BOOKS ARE 5x TIGHTER" CLAIM IS RETRACTED. IT WAS THE EXCLUSION. ***
  I originally read book/careerExp as a 0.89-1.08 band against a model spanning
  0.59-1.64 and called it five times the dispersion. That band existed ONLY
  because Hooker (0.45) and Peek (0.55) were dropped as "suspect books" - and
  both lines are now confirmed real. Put them back and the comparison dies:
      book   n=8  range 0.45-1.08  IQR 0.255  sd 0.251
      model  n=8  range 0.59-1.64  IQR 0.285  sd 0.341
  Nearly the same spread. The model's sd is ~36% higher, which is a whisper in
  the same direction at n=8 and nothing more. THE 50/50 BLEND HYPOTHESIS IS NOT
  SUPPORTED BY THIS DATA. Do not act on it, and do not re-derive it from the
  monotonic table above - that table is arithmetic, as noted.

  THE DEEPER LESSON: careerExp is too noisy to adjudicate. It misses the BOOK by
  up to 0.55, so it cannot be used to convict the model of anything. Excluding
  the rows where a reference disagrees most, then reporting how tight the
  remainder is, MANUFACTURES the result. That is what happened here.

  WHAT SURVIVES, REFERENCE-FREE: model minus book, per fighter, needs no
  careerExp at all -
      Cornolle +25.5  Hooker +24.5  Parnasse +21  Peek +8  Ziam +7.5
      Pinto -3  Sy -5  Bukauskas -11  Charriere -12
  A -12 to +25.5 disagreement with the market is real and large. WHOSE error it
  is remains open, and settling it needs a better reference than careerExp.
  THE HIT-RATE TOOL BELOW IS THAT REFERENCE - it asks an empirical question
  (did this fighter's own past fights clear this number) instead of comparing
  against a constructed expectation.

=== THE 9 CHAIN BREAKS WERE MY BUG - RESOLVED. round1 IS NOT ONE DECIMAL. ===
*** PropLinePredictorService:59  round1(v) = Math.round(v * 2) / 2  — NEAREST 0.5 ***
The name is a lie and it is the single most misleading identifier in this file.
EVERY stage output goes through it. Reconstructing with true 1dp puts the rebuilt
value up to 0.25 off, which reported a CHAIN BREAK on any row whose arithmetic did
not already land on the .5 grid - 9 of 28. Proven on the dumped strings:
    Hooker    fair 24.2 + cap 6.0 = 30.2 -> round1 30.0 = logged cal.before 30.0
    Charriere fair 33.2 - cap 6.0 = 27.2 -> round1 27.0 = logged cal.before 27.0
    Bukauskas .74x16.5 + .26x34.5 = 21.18 -> round1 21.0 = logged 21.0
NO unmodelled transform exists. The five known stages account for the whole move.
The same bug caused the lone formula MISMATCH (Bukauskas): a point estimate was
compared against a grid-snapped stored value. The check is now an INTERVAL derived
from each input's printed precision, snapped to the grid.
FIXED in the snippet, and there is now a REGRESSION FIXTURE built from the verbatim
dumped strings (scratchpad dryrun4) - all three rows read chain ok / formula ok,
and table 3 reproduces the live ratios exactly (0.45 / 1.06 / 0.98).
RE-RUN THE DECOMPOSITION. Trusted rows go 19 -> 28 and rows carrying a usable book
line go 4 -> ~13, so BOTH medians will move. The -4.0 / -7.0 pair above was
computed on the four survivors of a bug and should not be quoted.

=== RETRACTED: "TWO BOOK LINES DO NOT LOOK REAL". THE SCRAPE IS PERFECT. ===
USER CHECKED THE LIVE PICK6 BOARD 2026-09-01 02:55. Hooker 27.5 IS a real Pick6
Significant Strikes line. So is every other one - all TWELVE stored P6 SS lines
match the board exactly:
  Charriere 38.5  Ziam 38.5  Sygula 37.5  Parnasse 36.5  Lima 35.5  Page 31.5
  Cornolle 30.5   Hooker 27.5  Campbell 24.5  Peek 24.5  Sola 24.5  Ruziboev 22.5
No junk lines anywhere. The scraper is not the problem and never was.

WHAT WAS WRONG WAS MY TEST. It scored the posted line against the fighter's CAREER
MEAN SS scaled to expected minutes. A mean is the wrong reference for a line: it is
dragged up by high-volume outliers, while a line is priced near an outcome the book
expects beaten about half the time. Hooker read 0.45x and got flagged. DO NOT
REUSE THAT RATIO TEST - it is removed in favour of the hit-rate tool below.

FROM THE BOARD, AN OBSERVATION WORTH KEEPING: Hooker, Peek, Charriere, Sygula,
Sola and Ruziboev are all MORE-ONLY on Pick6 (no Less button). Charriere sits at
1.06 on the old ratio and Hooker at 0.45, so MORE-ONLY DOES NOT EXPLAIN A LOW
LINE and must not be treated as a tell. It is recorded because a one-sided market
is priced differently from a two-sided one, and ss_under_available already carries
the flag through to storage.

  *** RUN 2026-09-01 03:01 - THE HOOKER LINE IS PERFECT, AND MEAN/MEDIAN IS WHY ***
    Hooker  line 27.5 | mean 48.8 | MEDIAN 26.5 | RAW 12/24 = 50%
  The book posted a textbook 50/50 line and my ratio test called it fake because
  it read the MEAN of a violently skewed distribution (25-min wars at 95+ against
  quick finishes). MEAN 48.8 vs MEDIAN 26.5 on the same fighter. Whenever a
  fighter's mean and median separate like that, ANY mean-based reference is junk.

  FULL RUN (9 rows with one agreed book line):

  *** THIS IS THE v39 ANSWER, ARRIVED AT SIDEWAYS ***
  Checkpoint item 4 predicted that 3R history moving up to a 5R main would flip
  the SS hit-rate term, and named Hooker. MEASURED: RAW 50% -> v39 67% on Hooker,
  the largest upward move on the board, on exactly the fighter predicted.
  The term also works the OTHER way and harder: Bukauskas 54% -> 23% and Pinto
  50% -> 25%, because their fights are priced SHORT (expMin 8.9 and 7.0) so their
  history scales DOWN. Duration is not a Hooker-only correction.
  CAVEAT THAT MATTERS: production v39 in calcSSLean is gated behind DK round
  markets and is still DORMANT. This tool used the PREDICTOR's career-based
  expMin instead, so the numbers above are what v39 WOULD say, not what the board
  is currently doing. Re-check on Friday once DK posts.

  *** THE MODEL'S DIRECTION IS MOSTLY RIGHT; ITS MAGNITUDE IS NOT ***
  model-book direction vs the v39-normalised hit rate, 6/8 agree:
    Hooker +24.5 OVER / 67% OVER    agree      Charriere -12 UNDER / 33%  agree
    Peek    +8.0 OVER / 100% OVER   agree      Pinto      -3 UNDER / 25%  agree
    Ziam    +7.5 OVER /  45% UNDER  DISAGREE   Bukauskas -11 UNDER / 23%  agree
    Cornolle +25.5 OVER / 50% COIN  (no side)  Sy         -5 UNDER / 20%  agree
  SUPERSEDED - this used RAW-book. Redone on the SHIPPED number further down;
  see THE AGREEMENT TEST, REDONE. Kept only because the raw-vs-final contrast
  is the point. Original reading follows:
  So the estimator picks the SIDE well and overstates the DISTANCE badly:
  Hooker +24.5 against a 67% history, Cornolle +25.5 against a coin flip. That
  is a magnitude problem, and it is why the anchor's clamp makes the board look
  sane. It also means "fix the raw model" is the wrong framing - the side is
  already there.

  NO SINGLE REFERENCE EXPLAINS THE BOOKS. book/median runs 0.47 (Peek), 0.76
  (Bukauskas), 0.97, 1.00, 1.04 (Hooker), 1.10, 1.13, 2.26 (Sy). Books price
  opponent, style and matchup, not just the fighter's own log. Stop looking for
  one ratio that convicts them.

  STANDOUT, NOT A RECOMMENDATION: Peek 6/6 with a median of 52.5 against a 24.5
  More-only line is the largest apparent gap on the card. n=6, not
  opponent-adjusted (he faces Campbell), and the printed caveat applies in full.

=== *** THE ZIAM DISAGREEMENT WAS MY TEST READING THE WRONG NUMBER *** ===
ZIAM IS NOT A DISAGREEMENT. His SHIPPED line is 38.5 and the book is 38.5 -
final-book = 0.0, the board takes NO position on him. The "DISAGREE" came from
comparing the RAW estimator (46.0) against his history, and raw is not what
ships: 46 -> prior 44 -> anchor 41.5 -> calibration 38.5, landing on the book.

  Where the raw +7.5 comes from is plain: Ziam's own rate is 2.68 SS/min but
  Sola absorbs 4.53, so the 50/50 blend multiplies his own rate by 1.35. His
  own-rate-only projection is 34.4, his median is 35.0, the book is 38.5 - so the
  BOOK also adjusts up for Sola, by about +10%, where the model adjusts +35%.

  THAT STILL DOES NOT GENERALISE - I checked before believing it. Solving each
  book line for the opponent weight it implies, book = (own*(1-w) + opp*w)*K
  where K = expMin * ssMod * style:
      Hooker 2.80 | Sy 1.70 | Pinto 1.00 | Peek 1.00 | Ziam 0.17
      Cornolle -0.18 | Bukauskas -0.76 | Charriere -0.89
  Range -0.89 to +2.80 against the model's fixed 0.50. NO CONSISTENT WEIGHT. The
  books are not doing this calculation at all. Ziam is one row where the blend
  happens to push hard, not evidence of a pattern. The blend hypothesis stays
  dead - this is the THIRD time it has been offered and refused.

=== *** THE AGREEMENT TEST, REDONE ON THE SHIPPED NUMBER *** ===
The 6/8 figure recorded above used RAW-book. Wrong number - `final` is what the
board displays and what runLearningCycle reads. Redone on final-book:

  fighter     raw-book  final-book  side    v39    verdict
  Hooker        +24.5      -1.0    UNDER    67%    DISAGREE
  Peek           +8.0      -1.0    UNDER   100%    DISAGREE
  Ziam           +7.5       0.0    none     45%    (no side taken)
  Cornolle      +25.5      -1.0    UNDER    50%    (coin flip)
  Charriere     -12.0     -15.0    UNDER    33%    agree
  Pinto          -3.0      -6.0    UNDER    25%    agree
  Sy             -5.0      -8.0    UNDER    20%    agree
  Bukauskas     -11.0     -10.0    UNDER    23%    agree
  ON THE SHIPPED NUMBER: 4 agree, 2 disagree, 3 no-side.

  *** 8 OF 9 SHIPPED LINES SIT AT OR BELOW THE BOOK. *** That is the negated
  anchor sign, now visible in OUTPUT rather than inferred from code. It
  manufactures UNDER-side numbers across the board, and on the two rows with the
  strongest historical OVER case - Hooker 67%, Peek 100% - it produces the
  OPPOSITE side. This is the best argument yet for fixing the sign, and it
  arrived from a question about a different fighter.

=== *** THE RATCHET IS DEAD. ALL THREE CHECKS, AND ONE REVERSED MY SIGN. *** ===
LEARNING LOG READ 2026-09-01 03:12, 18 runs stored.
  1. TIMING     : 0 runs on/after v43 shipped. Decisive on its own.
  2. TRAJECTORY : UP 8 / DOWN 10, net -0.122. NOT monotone, and it moved DOWN.
  3. SIGNAL     : effectiveDelta.ss n=354, mean -2.555, pos 165 / neg 187.
                  The ratchet needed this POSITIVE. It is NEGATIVE.

  MY READING OF 1.056 WAS BACKWARDS. I argued "default sits above 1.0, so it is
  being pushed up". The trajectory shows it STARTED at 1.181 and has been coming
  DOWN ever since; 1.056 is a waypoint on a descent, not evidence of a climb.

  AND THE NUMBERS RECONCILE WITH bookCalibration, which is the reassuring part:
  mean effectiveDelta.ss -2.555 means predicted - posted ~ +2.55, and
  bookCal.global.SS reads +3.3. Same sign, same rough magnitude, two independent
  paths. Historically the stored SS line ran ABOVE the posted line and the
  learner was correctly damping it - slowly (-0.122 over 18 events), but in the
  right direction.

=== *** THE BROKEN LOOP IS TWO DAYS OLD, NOT LONGSTANDING - THIS IS THE FIX *** ===
For SS, EVERY correction layer between the estimator and the stored line arrived
on 2026-08-30:
    v41 calibrateToBooks          2026-08-30
    v43 applyBookPrior (SS)       2026-08-30  } "were FP-ONLY" - the v43 comment
    v43 applyMarketAnchorFor (SS) 2026-08-30  }  says so outright
BEFORE THAT, pred.ss.line WAS the raw estimator's output. The loop was SOUND for
all 18 logged runs, which is exactly why the learner tracked the error correctly.
So the broken-loop finding is real but it has NEVER YET AFFECTED A LEARNING RUN -
same timing as the sign bug, same first exposure: the Paris settle.

  FORWARD-LOOKING, AND THIS ONE IS A PREDICTION NOT A FINDING:
  current final-book median is -1.0, so the FIRST v43 settle will feed the learner
  effectiveDelta ~ +1.0 - positive, where 18 runs of history were negative. That
  is when the modifier starts being pushed UP against a raw estimator that is
  already hot. TEST IT AFTER PARIS: re-run this probe and check whether run 19
  flips the sign of mean effectiveDelta.ss. Do not assert it before then.

  *** THE FP HYPOTHESIS IS ALSO DEAD ON TIMING. TWO FOR TWO. ***
  I claimed FP's loop had been broken "since v22" and that the v27
  fp_global_modifier saturation was what that looks like. BOTH HALVES WRONG.

  A CORRECTION INSIDE THE ESTIMATOR DOES NOT BREAK THE LOOP. computeBookPriorFP
  is passed INTO predictFighter and runs inside predictFantasy, so the learner
  sees the number it produced. Only POST-HOC layers - ones sitting between the
  estimator and the stored line - break it. FP has exactly two:
      2026-04-27  FP book prior        INSIDE predictFantasy   loop SOUND
      2026-08-20  v27 renormalisation  fp_global_modifier -> 1.0
      2026-08-21  v31 applyMarketAnchor  POST-HOC   <- the break starts HERE
      2026-08-30  v41 calibrateToBooks   POST-HOC
  THE v27 SATURATION PREDATES THE FIRST POST-HOC LAYER BY ONE DAY. No such layer
  existed during those 18 cycles, so a broken loop cannot explain it. v27's own
  account stands: a genuinely over-predicting baseline the learner correctly
  damped, which became a double-correction once Step 2b fixed the bias at source.

  *** MEASURED 2026-09-01 03:32. TWO RUNS OF EXPOSURE, NO DETECTABLE EFFECT. ***
    runs loop SOUND (pre 08-21) : 16
    runs in the BROKEN window   : 2  - Hernandez vs. Rodrigues, Nurmagomedov vs.
                                      Song. Both post-v31 anchor; NEITHER post-v41.
    mean effectiveDelta.fp      : SOUND -0.747 (n=306) | BROKEN +0.105 (n=51)
    fp_global_modifier          : default 0.997, net -0.111 over the log,
                                  9 up / 8 down. NOT saturated (floor is 0.75).

  THE SIGN FLIP IS AN ARTIFACT - DO NOT REPORT IT AS ONE. The broken window is
  literally two runs whose means CANCEL: +8.274 (n=26) and -8.391 (n=25), giving
  +0.105. Sound-era per-run means span -25.1 to +7.6 with a run-level SD of 10.19,
  so the SE of a two-run mean is 7.21. The observed era difference is 0.85 -
  0.12 SE. Nothing. n=51 looks like a sample; it is two events.

  *** AND THE METRIC CANNOT TEST THE CLAIM ANYWAY ***
  targetKind reads 'none' on ALL 18 runs. Its own comment (types/index.ts:459)
  says it exists "so a later session can tell line-trained cycles from the older
  result-trained ones" - it was added by v40 on 2026-08-30, and the last run was
  08-29. So EVERY stored run is RESULT-trained: effectiveDelta.fp here measures
  `RLM-blended result - predicted`, not `posted line - predicted`. The broken-loop
  story is about the LINE target. This dataset cannot speak to it in either era.
  The probe's targetKind column was added for exactly this and earned its place.

  CONCLUSION: FP's loop break is REAL IN CODE, has TWO runs of exposure, shows no
  detectable effect, and the only available metric could not have detected one.
  Treat FP as untouched. Re-measure after Paris - run 19 will be the first
  line-trained AND post-v41 cycle, for FP and SS alike.

  THE TOOL: snippets/2026-09-01_fp_loop_readonly.js

  *** THE PATTERN TO STOP REPEATING ***
  Twice now I have proposed "an invisible correction has been quietly corrupting
  the learner for a long time", and twice the ship dates have killed it outright -
  the SS ratchet and this. BOTH breaks are days old and neither has touched a
  single learning run. CHECK THE SHIP DATE BEFORE BUILDING THE STORY, not after.

=== SUPERSEDED: A RATCHET, CONSISTENT WITH EVERY NUMBER BUT NOT PROVEN ===
(Kept for the reasoning trail. The probe above killed it on all three checks.)
median final-book = -1.0, so effectiveDelta = posted - predicted is systematically
about +1.0. The learner reads that as "predicting too low" and nudges
ss_pace_modifier UP. Observed default: 1.056 - ABOVE 1.0, when nothing else on
this board suggests the estimator runs cold.
  So: negated sign biases the stored line low -> learner pushes the pace modifier
  up -> the raw estimator runs hotter -> the anchor clamps harder. A loop that
  quietly ratchets. CONSISTENT with everything measured; NOT proven, because the
  causal chain needs the learning-log history (prop_predictor_learning_log_v1)
  and that has not been read. Do not state it as fact without that.

=== SCOPE CORRECTION - THE SIGN BUG DOES NOT REACH THE PICKS ===
All of the above is the PREDICTOR path: the displayed line, the delta-BOOK chips,
the PREDICTOR VS POSTED LINES panel, and runLearningCycle's target. BEST PICKS
leans come from calcSSLean, a SEPARATE engine that never reads PropPrediction
(see [[project_fp_moneyline_guard]]). So the sign bug is NOT currently producing
bad picks - it is corrupting the predictor's output and its own training signal.
That lowers the urgency and it should be stated whenever the sign comes up.

  THE TOOL:
    snippets/2026-09-01_ss_line_hitrate_readonly.js
  Asks what fraction of the fighter's OWN logged fights actually cleared the
  posted line - raw, and MODEL v39 duration-normalised to this fight's expected
  minutes, with mean beside median so an outlier-driven mean cannot hide. Also
  prints the More-only flag per book. Skips any fighter whose books disagree
  rather than averaging them. Dry-run verified: normalisation demonstrably moves
  a row (short-KO scaling took a 5/6 to 6/6), split-book rows are skipped.
  CAVEAT BUILT INTO THE OUTPUT: a high hit rate is the fighter's own past, not an
  opponent-adjusted forecast. It bounds the question. It does not settle it.

=== ALSO RETRACTED: THE RUZIBOEV "PULLED LINE" ===
Flagged at 02:26 as a possible line-removals-never-propagate case (no raw book
line, but a P6 chip on the board). The 02:48 run shows P6 22.5 present for him
and it matches the live board. A re-fetch landed between the two runs. NOT a bug.

  *** WHY THE LEARNER NEVER CORRECTS IT - THE LOOP IS BROKEN IN THE MIDDLE ***
  GENERATION: predictSS -> applyBookPrior -> applyMarketAnchorFor ->
    applyDebutMoneylineSplit -> calibrateToBooks -> savePredictions.
  LEARNING:   runLearningCycle -> getPredictions() -> `predicted = pred.ss.line`
    -> effectiveDelta = postedLine - predicted -> updates ss_pace_modifier
    -> which feeds predictSS, i.e. STEP ONE.
  The gradient is measured AFTER three market-correction layers and applied to a
  term BEFORE all of them. On this board effectiveDelta is about +1.0 (book 27.5,
  stored 26.5): relErr 3.6%, step +0.36%. The learner concludes it has CONVERGED,
  and on its own measurement it has. The estimator's error is corrected away
  before it is ever observed, so it is structurally unlearnable.
  Two more things would bite even if it could see it:
   - ss_pace_modifier is clamped [0.70, 1.40] with MAX_STEP_PER_EVENT 0.08. Taking
     12 off ~52 needs x0.77 - inside the clamp but near the floor. The v13 note at
     PropLinePredictorService ~230 records this EXACT saturation happening once
     already (lightHeavyweight pinned at 0.70) before being renormalised to 1.0.
   - `rate x expectedMin x mod` estimates E[STRIKES LANDED]. v40 changed the
     learning TARGET to the posted line and left the FORMULA estimating output.
     A multiplicative pace term can rescale an output estimator; it cannot turn it
     into a line estimator, and asking it to absorb a market convention destroys
     what the pace term means.

  DECOMPOSITION TOOL (read-only):
    snippets/2026-09-01_ss_decomposition_readonly.js
  Reconstructs every SS row as raw -> prior -> anchor -> debut -> calibration ->
  final purely from the stored reason strings, and SELF-CHECKS it: each stage's
  `after` must equal the next stage's `before`, so an unmodelled transform shows up
  as a CHAIN BREAK instead of being averaged in. Then recomputes the raw formula
  from its own logged inputs (rate / opp rate / expected minutes / ssMod / style /
  trend) to confirm the attribution, and finally checks each POSTED LINE against
  the fighter's UFCStats career rate. Medians are taken over unbroken rows only.

  DO NOT SKIP TABLE 3. The +12 is only predictor error if the lines are real.
  Hooker at Pick6 27.5 in a 5R main is about 0.55x his own career-rate expectation,
  and this repo has a documented junk-low-SS-line trap. If the line is wrong, the
  gap measured against it means nothing.

  WHAT FLIPPING THE SIGN ALONE WOULD DO: every anchored SS line moves +2S = +6.6.
  Hooker 26.5 -> 33.5 (+6.0 OVER the book). Charriere 23.5 -> 29.5. The board goes
  from systematically under the book to systematically over it. The negation is
  currently cancelling roughly half of the raw +12. FIX THE PREDICTOR FIRST, OR
  FIX BOTH TOGETHER AND RE-MEASURE - never the sign by itself.

=== THE FIRST VERDICT RULE WAS WRONG, AND HOW ===
The snippet's original headline test (the delta band) returned "NOT consistent -
drop the claim" on a board that does carry the defect. Two faults, both mine:
  1. applyDebutMoneylineSplit runs AFTER the anchor and moves sp.line while leaving
     anchoredFrom stale. Parnasse was anchored to 36.2, debut-split +6.7 to 42.9,
     calibrated -3.3 to 39.5 - 6.0 ABOVE his book line, which the band said was
     impossible. Reconstructs to the displayed 39.5 exactly. Now excluded and
     reported, never counted.
  2. The band's "posted" input was itself fair + S, so it could not disagree with
     the sign it was testing. CIRCULAR. Replaced with shift = fair - (RAW book
     line), which reads one number from the reason string and one from a store the
     anchor never writes.
The lesson is the 357 lesson from the other direction: a test built on the
mechanism it is testing will confirm or deny whatever you built into it. The
snippet is amended and both scenarios (negated / corrected) were dry-run in node.

=== SMALLER, WORTH ONE CHECK ===
Ruziboev's SS resolved to NO raw book line (exact name match, all five stores) at
02:26, while the board painted a "P6 22.5" chip for him at 01:56 and he sits in
DRIFTERS. That is the shape of the known line-removals-never-propagate bug -
mergeFighters can add or change a line but never remove one, so a pulled line
keeps rendering. It could also just be a re-fetch between the two timestamps.
One check, not a conclusion.

=== WHAT THE BOARD SAYS THAT IS NOT ABOUT THE ANCHOR ===
The five big model-vs-book unders are all FINISHERS or short-fight profiles.
estimateExpectedMinutes is pFinish*avgFinishMin + (1-pFinish)*fullLength, so a
high finish rate pulls expected minutes down hard and SS scales with it; books
do not discount that steeply. That is a real disagreement worth grading after
Paris, and it is SEPARABLE from the anchor question - do not fold them together.

*** DO NOT RUN `npm run checkpoint:save` WITHOUT -Notes. ***
resume.ps1 save mode REGENERATES THIS WHOLE FILE from a template and writes
`## Last Notes` = `(none)` when -Notes is empty (resume.ps1:138-158). That would
delete every line above this - the entire accumulated project record. The Last
Notes section is maintained BY HAND and always has been.
If you ever do want the script's header refresh, pass the full notes body:
  npm run checkpoint:save -- -Notes "..."
Otherwise edit this file directly, which is what every session has done.
